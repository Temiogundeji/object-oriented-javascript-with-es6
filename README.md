# [Object-Oriented JavaScript With ES6][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


In this course, Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you everything you need to know in order to write object-oriented JavaScript. You'll learn how to use the different creational patterns, such as factory functions, constructor functions, and classes. You'll also learn how to use the new tools in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to implement truly private encapsulation in your code. Finally, you'll also learn the different JavaScript inheritance patterns for reusing  existing code. 

At the end of this course, we'll apply everything we've learned to write a custom event system and a simple toolbar component.

Throughout the course, Jeremy will demonstrate the new syntax  in ES6 and also the patterns for achieving object-orientation that have been used in older versions of JavaScript.
